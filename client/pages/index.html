            <h2><img class="HIcon" src="img/HIcon.png" alt="Icon">About Monster Hunter Rise</h2>
            <p>Monster Hunter Rise is the latest entry in the wildly popular Action RPG Series. Following the success of
                Monster Hunter World, Capcom reiterates on its tried and true formula, once again evolving the series
                and taking it to new heights. Monster Hunter Rise is set in the colorful Kamura Village, an all-new
                serene mountain locale that attracts visitors with its unique culture and innovative hunting
                technologies. After hunters equip their armor and select from one of the various weapon types, all-new
                hunting grounds await, including the ancient Shrine Ruins and more. As players defeat monsters and
                progress through the game, items from fallen foes can be used to craft unique weapons and armor that
                will increase their chances of future success and survival. Hunters can tackle these challenges solo, or
                with up to three other players in local or cooperative online play.</p>

            <section>
                <h3><img class="HIcon" src="img/GS.png" alt="Icon">Great Sword</h3>
                <p>Large, powerful but slow heavy-damagers. This massive blade prioritizes damage over speed, boasting
                powerful swings and staggering blows. There are few weapons as intimidating as the Greatsword, as it has
                low mobility, but with the right tips and tricks, players can overcome this weapon's shortcomings. The
                Greatsword is one of the most classic weapons in the Monster Hunter series, and even if it's a slow tool
                in nature, over the years many improvements in mobility helped it to retain its efficiency at all times.
                Monster Hunter Rise further improves upon that with many different Skills and Abilities that will change
                depending on your preferences. But regardless of what's your approach in battle, one thing is for sure:
                The Greatsword is at its best moment. </p>

                <h3><img class="HIcon" src="img/LS.png" alt="Icon">Longsword</h3>
                <p>The Longsword is a very satisfying weapon to use. It's as intimidating as it is large, but offers
                    more mobility than its size lets on. The weapon's moveset and central gimmick reward the more
                    aggressive playstyles out there, but there are some pretty neat ways to use the Longsword as a tool
                    of evasion and counterattacking if you have the timing down. With Rise's silkbinds, the weapon's
                    playstyle gets even more floaty and chaotic and will be a favorite of those who love to run circles
                    around their foes. You'll notice that when you have a Longsword equipped, you have a new gauge
                    available to the right of your sharpness meter. This is your Spirit Gauge.
                    Your Spirit Gauge will fill automatically as you connect with normal attacks, filling up the white
                    bar in the middle of the sword-shaped meter. You can use this gauge to perform Spirit Blade attacks
                    with ZR/RT, which are some of your most powerful attacks, and emit a trailing light from the tip of
                    your sword. </p>

                <h3><img class="HIcon" src="img/SnS.png" alt="Icon">Sword and Shield</h3>
                <p>The Sword and Shield is one of Monster Hunter Rise's most versatile weapons. Although it may seem
                    simple at first, this weapon can do just about anything you need it to, with a fast-paced
                    close-range playstyle that is extremely rewarding to use once you get the hang of it. The Sword and
                    Shield is, at first glance, a very basic weapon. Unlike more flashier weapons like the Charge Blade
                    or Switch Axe, the Sword and Shield has no unique gauge or charging mechanics.

                    While this may make the weapon look uninteresting, the Sword and Shield shines in its simplicity.
                    With its varied attacks, you can dart around the monster, always on the offensive while stringing
                    together combos and using a variety of tools for anything the monster can throw at you.

                    In addition, you can block lighter attacks using the shield. Blocking an attack will greatly reduce
                    the amount of damage it does, but bigger attacks will push you back slightly, knocking you off
                    balance. Blocking should really only be reserved for situations where you can't dodge the attack.

                    The Sword and Shield's unique mechanic allows you to use items without sheathing your weapon. By
                    holding the block button and then pressing the use item button, you can consume items without
                    sheathing the Sword and Shield, letting you get back into the fight faster. </p>

                <h3><img class="HIcon" src="img/DB.png" alt="Icon">Dual Blades</h3>
                <p>The Dual Blades are one of the fastest weapons in Monster Hunter Rise, allowing you to dodge around
                    the monster while remaining on the attack. With swift attacks, the option to dodge between
                    animations, and aerial abilities, the Dual Blades are the perfect weapon for hunters who like to
                    keep things fast-paced. The Dual Blades are a fast-paced weapon that can fit into several different
                    types of builds. Because of their high hit count, elemental and status-applying builds work the
                    best, but raw-damage builds can be equally strong with the right equipment and circumstances.

                    By pressing ZR, you will enter Demon Mode, draining stamina over time but increasing attack and
                    movement speed, granting access to new combos and dodges. Managing your various resources is the
                    core of the Dual Blades' gameplay. Through stamina, Demon Gauge, and sharpness, you'll need to keep
                    a constant eye on what resources you have, and when to use them.

                    To that end, stamina-boosting armor skills like Constitution or Marathon Runner will greatly
                    increase the amount of time you are able to spend in Demon Mode. </p>

                <h3><img class="HIcon" src="img/CB.png" alt="Icon">Charge Blade</h3>
                <p>Charge up your phials and knock your enemies down with Charge Blade! The second of two switchy-swappy weapons in
                the game, the Charge Blade playstyle lets you charge up Phials in Sword Mode, and expend them in Axe Mode! Guard against
                enemy attacks with the power of your Guard Points, charge up your shield, and blow monsters away with your Amped
                Elemental Discharge Axe attacks! The Charge Blade is complicated because it needs efficiency with Phials to be
                effective. Essentially, the player wants to charge Phials when in Sword Mode and then switch to Axe Mode to discharge
                all of them. They need to be careful not to overheat the Phial Gauge too, or else attacks will literally bounce off
                monsters. When that Gauge is yellow, that means three Phials are charged; red means five Phials are charged.
                
                Something incredibly important to note is that the Charge Blade offers a legit shield accessible through the Sword Mode.
                The player can utilize Guard Points, blocking and opening up the opportunity for counterattacks, by aiming the shield in
                the direction of incoming attacks. These are also possible through Morph Slash, which is accessible through the sword
                and the axe.
                
                Despite the weapon being slow to swing, it actually offers solid mobility during Sword Mode. This goes downhill during
                Axe Mode in exchange for greater power. The Charge Blade is a decent hybrid of defense and offense but definitely
                requires practice to be used properly.
